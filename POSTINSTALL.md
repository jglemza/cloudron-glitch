Accounts are created with the username and the subdomain under which this app is installed
 e.g. `@$CLOUDRON-USERNAME@$CLOUDRON-APP-DOMAIN`. Note that Mastodon does allow this subdomain
to be changed later as it breaks federation. So, you have to install Mastodon in the correct
subdomain from the get-go.
