Accounts are created with the username and the subdomain under which this app is installed
 e.g. `@$CLOUDRON-USERNAME@$CLOUDRON-APP-DOMAIN`. Note that Mastodon does NOT allow this subdomain
to be changed later as it breaks federation. So, you have to install Mastodon in the correct
subdomain from the get-go.

**note:** Mastodon has [restrictions](https://docs.cloudron.io/apps/mastodon/#username-restriction) on usernames
that might prevent some users from logging in.
